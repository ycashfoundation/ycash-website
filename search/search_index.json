In fact, the software for Ycash is based on the software for Zcash, which in turn is based on the software for Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin and Zcash, the total supply of Ycash is forever capped at 21 million coins. So, unlike government-issued paper cash, you never have to worry about inflation devaluing your Ycash. Ycash also shares something else in common with Zcash: shared blockchain history. The first 570,000 blocks of the Ycash blockchain are the same as the first 570,000 blocks of the Zcash blockchain. That means that everyone in control of Zcash private keys as of block height 570,000 (around July 18, 2019) will be able to use those private keys to access the same amount of Ycash. Bitcoin is truly revolutionary, but it suffers from several problems, including the following two key problems: The Privacy Problem. Bitcoin lacks privacy. The whole world can see all of your transactions. The Distribution Problem. The ongoing initial distribution of bitcoin (via \"mining\") is dominated by manufacturers of specialized computer hardware and their business partners. Zcash improved upon Bitcoin by implementing a revolutionary solution to The Privacy Problem. But The Distribution Problem remains. By building upon the Zcash codebase, Ycash leverages Zcash's solution to The Privacy Problem. And by aggressively pursuing mining on commodity hardware by all available means, including periodic changes to Ycash's mining algorithm, Ycash aims to address The Distribution Problem. We believe that addressing The Distribution Problem is necessary for a digital currency to achieve widespread, grassroots adoption. As one engineer working on Ycash put it, if the mining process is largely controlled by specialized hardware created by a far-off foreign manufacturer, the coin seems \"distant\". Mining is an important way for users to participate in a digital currency's community, and mining on commodity hardware opens up the mining process up to a much larger group of users. Another key component of Ycash's approach to addressing The Distribution Problem is upholding a promise that originated from Zcash: that 90% of the coins would be distributed via the mining process. The structure of the Ycash Development Fund upholds that promise: With 5% of the coins starting at block height 570,000 going to the Ycash Development Fund (managed by the nonprofit Ycash Foundation ), 90% of the total 21 million Ycash coins will be allocated via the free market mining process. But there are several other coins that also build upon the Zcash codebase and are also trying to address The Distribution Problem; what makes Ycash different? The answer goes back to Ycash's shared blockchain history with Zcash. Ycash is the only coin that is also a chain fork of Zcash. So, not only does Ycash build upon the codebase of Zcash like many other coins, it also uniquely builds upon Zcash's blockchain too. Therefore, the Zcash community, including the world-class engineers and cryptographers at the Electric Coin Company, have a vested interest in Ycash's success (to the extent that those individuals hold Zcash at the time of the Zcash/Ycash split). Ycash is standing on the shoulders of two giants: Bitcoin and Zcash. We will aggressively compete with both (and all other digital currencies) for user and merchant adoption.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"Ycash is a digital currency, like Bitcoin or Zcash.

This page is maintained here for historical purposes. Introduction The Ycash/Zcash fork occurred at block height 570,000 of the Zcash blockchain, approximately July 18, 2019). This page focuses on the mechanics of the fork. For the motivations behind the fork, see \"Announcing Ycash, The First \u201cFriendly Fork\u201d of the Zcash Blockchain\" (2019-04-11) . Key Changes at Launch At launch, Ycash implements the following key changes to Zcash: The mining algorithm is changed from Equihash(200,9) to Equihash(192,7). The Zcash Founders Reward rate is reduced from 20% to a perpetual 5%, with the entirety going to the nonprofit Ycash Foundation. The Zcash Founders Reward is renamed the Ycash Development Fund. In order to eliminate confusion between Ycash and Zcash going forward, the address formats are changed (as described in the next section). Ycash Address Formats Ycash uses different address formats than Zcash, making it impossible to accidentally send Zcash to a Ycash address (or Ycash to a Zcash address). Transparent addresses start with \"s1\" instead of \"t1\". Multisig addresses start with \"s3\" instead of \"t3\". Shielded sprout addresses start with \"yc\" instead of \"zc\". Shield sapling addresses start with \"ys\" instead of \"zs\". Two-Way Replay Protection Replay attacks involve an attacker using a publicly broadcasted transaction on one chain to perform an unauthorized transaction on another chain. Ycash utilizes the two-way replay protection built in to Zcash's upgrade mechanism (first introduced in Zcash's Overwinter upgrade). Therefore, users and exchanges need not worry about replay attacks.

Diversified addresses are a feature of Sapling addresses that let you generate multiple Sapling addresses from the same private key. That is, a single Sapling spending or viewing key can create 1000s of Sapling addresses. These addresses are called \"diversified addresses\". Diversified addresses are indistinguishable from regular addresses. In addition, they are also unlinkable\u2014that is, it is not possible to identify two addresses as diversified, without having access to their private keys. What are the uses for diversified addresses? Generally, it is a good idea to hand out a unique address to each party you are transacting with, so that even if they collude, they will not be able to link all your addresses together. For example, you might want to give out a different address to each exchange you interact with. While you can generate regular addresses, each time you generate a new address, you need to take care to backup its private key. This process is especially problematic if you are using an address from a paper wallet, as it might be too expensive or time consuming to generate a new paper address. With diversified addresses, you can simply generate a new address each time you want to give someone your Sapling address, without having to worry about backing up the private key. How do I use diversified addresses? ycashd 2.0.6 introduces two new RPC calls to manage diversified addresses. z_getnewdiversifiedaddress and z_getalldiversifiedaddresses . z_getnewdiversifiedaddress This RPC call will generate a new diversified address from an existing Sapling address. Remember that both of these addresses will share the same private key (both spending key and viewing key). $ ./ycash-cli z_getnewdiversifiedaddress ys179dzraxjvg9hhsdny0582v4ngrmh9fgmdnwq7rcnessfdfcsktyxshzzjpjvdyslkchnqnxfnml ys16eu760jpej3keda4crmcmsj3ef2wyrfj7uy8gd9qrzfwfwrggjnevnf75ywer59gqwes7l7mtnw This will generate a new address that shares the same private key as the address you supplied, and will add the new address into your wallet. z_getalldiversifiedaddresses This RPC call will get all the diversified addresses that the given address is associated with. You can call this RPC call with any sapling address, and it will return all the other addresses in the wallet that share the same private key with the given address. That is, it will return all the diversified addresses associated with the given address. $ ./ycash-cli z_getalldiversifiedaddresses ys179dzraxjvg9hhsdny0582v4ngrmh9fgmdnwq7rcnessfdfcsktyxshzzjpjvdyslkchnqnxfnml [ \"ys1k33cd4r4jm44fvzypdtq970k555jlpeq483xdj8h7km3gg6lnpdm24pctq7evhnkwuptvy57z6v\", \"ys179dzraxjvg9hhsdny0582v4ngrmh9fgmdnwq7rcnessfdfcsktyxshzzjpjvdyslkchnqnxfnml\" ] Note that diversified addresses don't have a \"master\" address or \"sub-addresses\". All of them are peer addresses associated with the same private key. Which means you can call z_getalldiversifiedaddresses with any of the diversified address to get the full set of diversified addresses that share the same private key. What are the Pros and Cons of using diversified addresses? PROs Generate essentially an infinite number of addresses from the same private key No need to backup private keys when generating new diversified addresses Makes it easy to give each party you inteact with a new address CONs All the diversified addresses share the same private key, so you can't for example, disclose the viewing key for just one address. If you give out the viewing key for one addresses, all the diversified addresses associated with that key will become visible. In the event that zk-SNARKs (the technology underlying Sapling shielded addresses) are ever broken, an attacker might be able to craft some interactive attacks which may make it possible to link together diversified addresses. There is a plan to address this in future releases.

For example, you might want to give out a different address to each exchange you interact with. While you can generate regular addresses, each time you generate a new address, you need to take care to backup its private key. This process is especially problematic if you are using an address from a paper wallet, as it might be too expensive or time consuming to generate a new paper address.

To implement a mining pool for Ycash, the following Ycash-specific changes need to be implemented. 1. Equihash Parameters Ycash uses Equihash <192, 7>. So the mining pool code needs to update the Equihash parameters to n=192, k=7. Note that this also includes changing the personalization string. While the first 8 bytes of the personalization string remains the same (\u201cZcashPoW\u201d), bytes 8-12 should be updated to (little endian)192 and bytes 12-16 should be updated to (little endian)7. See: https://github.com/ycashfoundation/ycash/blob/master/src/crypto/equihash.cpp#L36 2. Address formats Ycash transparent addresses begin with \u201cs\u201d (instead of Zcash\u2019s \u201ct\u201d). So the coinbase mining reward transaction should pay the mining reward to an \u201cs\u201d address. 3. Founders reward There are 2 changes: At the time of the Ycash/Zcash fork in July 2019, the Zcash Founders Reward was 20% of blocks until the first block halving at block height 850,000. In contrast, the Ycash Development Fund donation rate is 5% perpetually and is paid out to a new set of addresses. So the coinbase \"founders reward\" should be updated to: Pay 5% (instead of 20%) Pay to vYcashFoundersRewardAddress[] ( instead of vFoundersRewardAddress[]). The addresses rotate every 17917 blocks. See https://github.com/ycashfoundation/ycash/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L642 Ycash Development Fund addresses are regular addresses (not multisig addresses like in Zcash).
