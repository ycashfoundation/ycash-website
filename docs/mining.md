# Mining

## Getting Started

Mining is a great way to get involved with Ycash. To effectively mine Bitcoin or
Zcash, you need to purchase an expensive, specialized computer called an ASIC.
In contrast, you can effectively mine Ycash with a commodity graphics processing
unit (GPU) that you may already have in your computer.
