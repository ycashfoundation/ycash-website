# Wallets
In order to use Ycash, you need a Ycash wallet, and there are many great wallets to choose from.

## Ycash Foundation Wallets

### YecLite

YecLite is lightweight desktop wallet for MacOS, Linux, and Windows. YecLite allows you to use Ycash without having to download the Ycash blockchain.

For most users, YecLite is the easiest way to enjoy the full power of the Ycash network.

YecLite is developed by the yecdev team and vetted by the Ycash Foundation.

### YecWallet

YecWallet is a full node Ycash wallet. It includes ycashd, the node software that powers the Ycash network, and will take care of configuring ycashd for you!

Because it is a full node, YecWallet will download the entire Ycash blockchain via the Ycash peer-to-peer network. (Currently, the blockchain is around 21 GB.)
