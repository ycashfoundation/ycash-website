## Ysimple

### Introduction

Ysimple is a ultra-lightweight mobile Ycash wallet designed to minimize mobile
network bandwidth usage even as the number shielded Ycash transactions
increases. To achieve this, Ysimple sends a partially encrypted version of the
wallet.dat file to Ycash Foundation servers. Our servers never see your spending
keys, so your funds remain secure. In order to carry out its function, our
servers need to  view your wallets viewing keys, which allows our servers to
view your wallet's transactions. Tnis is similar to how many Bitcoin light
wallets operate, but it is very different than the light client protocol used by
YecLite, which does not allow the server to view the client's transactions.

### Key Points

1. Our servers never have access to your spending keys.

2. Our servers have access to your viewing keys, so our servers have access to
your transaction history.

3. We only use access to your viewing keys and transaction history:
    - to update your wallet.dat file and send it back to; and
    - notify you of incoming transactions

4. We do not store your wallet-related-information beyond the scope of your
mobile client's interactions with our servers.

5. We only disclose information to a third party if compelled to do so by a valid
and legally-enforceable subpoena.
